# Overview {-}

LexOPS is an R package and shiny app for generating matched items for an experiment. LexOPS can generate stimuli for any factorial design, controlling for selected variables. The package has an inbuilt database of features for English words (`LexOPS::lexops`), but the package can work with any database which includes features for a finite set of items.

This book introduces LexOPS with some examples.
