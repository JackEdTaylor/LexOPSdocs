# Overview {-}

LexOPS is an R package and web/shiny app for generating word stimuli, for use in Psychology experiments. LexOPS can generate stimuli for a factorial design specified by the user, controlling for selected lexical variables. The package has an inbuilt database of features for English words (`LexOPS::lexops`), but the user can also use their own list of features, for English words and/or for words in other languages.

This site explains most features of LexOPS, and provides some example applications.
